SportSync ‚Äî Layer-Z Sports Identity Recommender

SportSync turns short answers into three clear ‚Äúsport-identity‚Äù cards, each with a qualitative first week, VR / no-VR variants, and a warm human tone.
It is Knowledge-Base-first (KB-first) and only uses an LLM as a fallback, with hard de-duplication, safety guards, and optional telemetry.

The Idea ¬∑ The Goal ¬∑ The Dream

Let‚Äôs say it plainly, with your voice: bold, clear, deep, future-oriented.

You‚Äôre not building ‚Äúa fitness app.‚Äù
You‚Äôre not building ‚Äúa cute AI.‚Äù

You‚Äôre building an intelligent system that uncovers a person‚Äôs true sport identity‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs buried under 20 years of boredom, pressure, or fear of failure.

An AI that can tell someone:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not inactive because you‚Äôre lazy‚Ä¶ you just haven‚Äôt met your true sport yet.‚Äù

üéØ Goal

Design AI that discovers each person‚Äôs innate sport‚Äîregardless of their style, mood, or past.
	‚Ä¢	Not ‚Äúthe sport that‚Äôs trending.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Not ‚Äúthe one that slims you down.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Not ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù

The sport that fits you, and only you.

üí° What do we mean by ‚Äúinnate sport‚Äù? (real examples)
	‚Ä¢	Example 1
Hates the gym, hates crowds‚Ä¶ but on a bike they disappear into themselves.
‚Üí Not ‚Äúcardio.‚Äù That‚Äôs Internal Escape.
‚Üí The AI proposes: Bikepacking ‚Äî Solitude Mode (an inventive cycling identity with mental maps and ‚Äúescape routes‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Example 2
Loves dance, shy, hates competition, craves free breathing.
‚Üí Not ‚ÄúZumba.‚Äù
‚Üí The AI proposes: Flow Dance Therapy (an expressive VR session with no audience).
	‚Ä¢	Example 3
Gamer, chaotic, but secretly loves order.
‚Üí Not ‚ÄúCrossFit.‚Äù
‚Üí The AI proposes: Combat Rhythm Sports (blending VR + tactical combat + lane sequencing).

‚öôÔ∏è How it works (no fluff)
	1.	Ask ~20 smart questions (with Layer-Z that reveals deep drivers).
	2.	Analyze your profile across 141 layers (psychological, cognitive, environmental).
	3.	Fuse with a KB of 8,000+ sports (including obscure/experimental).
	4.	Then deliver:
	‚Ä¢	A realistic identity you could start tomorrow,
	‚Ä¢	A fallback if #1 doesn‚Äôt click,
	‚Ä¢	An inventive identity true to your makeup (non-traditional if needed).

üí• Why it matters
	‚Ä¢	People quit not because they‚Äôre weak‚Äîbut because they‚Äôve never seen themselves in the sport.
	‚Ä¢	Health systems treat sport as a class, not an identity.
	‚Ä¢	Millions burn cash on memberships and walk away after a week‚Äîno real match.

üé§ The dream, directly

‚ÄúI want a system that lets anyone, anywhere discover the sport that feels innate‚Äîas if they were born with it.
An intelligent bridge between emotion and movement‚Äîwilling to invent a new sport if it must.‚Äù

Features
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Gate
Rejects recommendations when answers are insufficient; asks 3 concise follow-ups first.
	‚Ä¢	KB-First Pipeline
Uses data/sportsync_knowledge.json (priors, trait_links, guards, label aliases, optional identities)
	‚Ä¢	ready-made templates per label ‚Üí full cards without LLM.
	‚Ä¢	Layer-Z Alignment
Uses Z-axes (Calm/Adrenaline, Solo/Group, Technical/Intuitive), Z-intent keywords, and simple text signals.
	‚Ä¢	Three complete cards
sport_label, ‚Äúwhat it looks like,‚Äù inner sensation, why you, first week (qualitative), progress markers, win condition, 3‚Äì5 core skills, mode, VR & no-VR variants, difficulty 1‚Äì5.
	‚Ä¢	Safety & wording rules
Hard filter to avoid time/cost/reps/sets/minutes/venues.
Optional: allow or mask sport names (allow_sport_names).
	‚Ä¢	Hard de-dup (local + global)
Uses data/blacklist.json to avoid repeats; generates variant labels when needed.
	‚Ä¢	Soft caching
Caches coach persona & recommendations for identical inputs.
	‚Ä¢	LLM as fallback
If KB can‚Äôt cover, call the LLM once + an optional repair round to improve alignment and completeness.

Quick Install

Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Python 3.10+
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI-compatible API key (only needed if LLM fallback is enabled)

git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> sportsync
cd sportsync

python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt

Optional if you‚Äôll use the LLM fallback:

# macOS/Linux
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-yourkey"
# Windows (PowerShell)
# setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-yourkey"


‚∏ª

One-Liner Test

python -c "from core.backend_gpt import generate_sport_recommendation as g; print('\n\n'.join(g({'q1':'I prefer solo, calm play with precision aim','q2':'Open to trying VR'}, lang='English', user_id='demo')))"


‚∏ª

Programmatic Usage

from core.backend_gpt import generate_sport_recommendation

answers = {
    "goal": "Tactical identity with quick wins and deep focus",
    "style": "Leaning calm & breath-led; mostly solo",
    "vr": "Curious to try VR later"
}

cards = generate_sport_recommendation(
    answers=answers,
    lang="English",      # or "ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©"
    user_id="user-123",  # used for caching/telemetry
    job_id="req-001"
)

print("\n\n---\n\n".join(cards))


‚∏ª

Inputs & Outputs

Input (flexible dict)

Free-form keys with short, clear sentences.
Optional profile if you already encode axes/signals in your platform.

{
  "goal": "Calm identity with occasional snap decisions",
  "preference": "Solo, stealth/visual feints, precision/aim",
  "vr": "Maybe VR later",
  "profile": {
    "axes": {"calm_adrenaline": -0.6, "solo_group": -0.4, "tech_intuition": -0.3},
    "signals": ["precision","stealth"],
    "vr_inclination": 0.5
  }
}

Output

The function returns a list of 3 strings (cards). Each card contains:
	‚Ä¢	Sport label / identity
	‚Ä¢	What it looks like (scene)
	‚Ä¢	Inner sensation
	‚Ä¢	Why it fits you
	‚Ä¢	Core skills (3‚Äì5)
	‚Ä¢	Win condition
	‚Ä¢	First week (qualitative, no reps/sets/time/venue)
	‚Ä¢	VR and No-VR variants
	‚Ä¢	Approx difficulty 1‚Äì5

Content is scrubbed to avoid time, cost, reps/sets/minutes, or explicit venues.

	‚Ä¢	OPENAI_ORG ‚Äî optional org id
	‚Ä¢	CHAT_MODEL ‚Äî main model (default: gpt-4o)
	‚Ä¢	CHAT_MODEL_FALLBACK ‚Äî fallback model (default: gpt-4o-mini)
	‚Ä¢	REC_BUDGET_S ‚Äî per-request time budget (default: 22)
	‚Ä¢	REC_REPAIR_ENABLED ‚Äî enable repair round (default: 1)
	‚Ä¢	REC_FAST_MODE ‚Äî shorten prompts & tokens (default: 0)
	‚Ä¢	REC_DEBUG ‚Äî print debug logs (default: 0)
	‚Ä¢	MAX_PROMPT_CHARS ‚Äî LLM prompt clipping (default: 6000)

Example get_config() return

{
  "llm": {"model": "gpt-4o"},
  "recommendations": {
    "allow_sport_names": true,
    "min_chars": 220,
    "require_win_condition": true,
    "min_core_skills": 3
  },
  "analysis": {
    "egate": {
      "min_answered": 3,
      "min_total_chars": 120,
      "required_keys": []  # e.g. ["goal","injury_history"]
    }

Data Layout
	‚Ä¢	data/sportsync_knowledge.json
priors, trait_links, guards.high_risk_sports, z_intent_keywords, optional identities, label_aliases‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	data/labels_aliases.json
Canonicalization of label names & forbidden generic labels.
	‚Ä¢	data/blacklist.json
Updated automatically to prevent global label duplication across sessions.

If data files are missing, the engine still runs with internal fallbacks.

‚∏ª

REST API (optional)

Minimal FastAPI server (server/main.py):

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from core.backend_gpt import generate_sport_recommendation

app = FastAPI(title="SportSync API")

class Req(BaseModel):
    answers: dict
    lang: str = "English"
    user_id: str = "N/A"
    job_id: str = ""

@app.post("/recommend")
def recommend(req: Req):
    cards = generate_sport_recommendation(req.answers, req.lang, req.user_id, req.job_id)
    return {"cards": cards}

Run:

uvicorn server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --reload


‚∏ª

Docker (optional)

Dockerfile

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
EXPOSE 7860
CMD ["uvicorn", "server.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "7860"]

Build & run:

docker build -t sportsync .
docker run -it --rm -p 7860:7860 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" sportsync


‚∏ª

Troubleshooting & FAQ
	‚Ä¢	I get ‚ÄúOPENAI_API_KEY not set.‚Äù
Set the key or disable LLM fallback (KB-only still works with reduced coverage).
	‚Ä¢	Cards mention time/sets/venue.
They shouldn‚Äôt. Text is scrubbed; check custom templates and allow_sport_names plus filters in core/backend_gpt.py.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs feel repetitive.
data/blacklist.json prevents repeats globally. The engine also generates variant labels when necessary.
	‚Ä¢	I want stricter safety.
Add forbidden patterns to guards in the KB and adjust _FORBIDDEN_SENT.

‚∏ª

Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ KB-first pipeline, Evidence Gate, Layer-Z alignment, VR/no-VR variants
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ Weighted evaluation & A/B telemetry for card quality
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ UI with interactive ‚Äúidentity preview‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ Export cards to shareable images & short videos
	‚Ä¢	‚è≥ Native mobile client
