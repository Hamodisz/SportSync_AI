## 🎯 MISSION (الهدف الأساسي)

### العربية:
> **"نساعد كل شخص يكتشف الرياضة المثالية له من خلال تحليل نفسي عميق بالذكاء الاصطناعي"**

SportSync AI ليس مجرد نظام توصيات رياضية - هو **مكتشف الهوية الرياضية** الذي يفهم شخصيتك، قيودك، ودوافعك الخفية ليقترح الرياضة التي ستحبها فعلاً.

### English:
> **"We help every person discover their perfect sport through deep AI-powered psychological analysis"**

SportSync AI isn't just a sports recommendation system - it's a **Sport Identity Discovery Engine** that understands your personality, constraints, and hidden motivations to suggest sports you'll actually love.
